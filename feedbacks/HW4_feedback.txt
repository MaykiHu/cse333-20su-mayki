HW4 Feedback


Test Suite: 250/250


Valgrind: 5/5


Modularity: 5/5


Robustness and error checking: 5/10
(-3) FileReader.cc copies code from ReadFileToString in HW2 instead of calling it. Also, has resource leaks on failure.
(-1) HttpServer_ThrFn closes the socket before HttpConnection is destructed. Since HttpConnection destructor closes the socket, this results in closing the socket twice.
(-1) Does not sanitize HTML (i.e. XSS security vulnerability). Should EscapeHtml the users's query in ProcessQueryRequest.

Comments, Blending with starter code and other style issues:  4/5
(-1) Some cpplint warnings that should have been fixed.


Server Test:  0/10
(-1) Creates new connection for every request. Define connection outside the while loop in HttpServer::ThrFn.
(-3) Static pages are unreachable.
(-4) 333gle does not show any results
(-2) Encounters Segmentation fault (or other fatal error) when running
